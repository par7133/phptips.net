    <TITLE>Unicode call to Multibyte</TITLE>
    <BODY><![CDATA[      
When you are going to develop a web application tailored for a broad audience using Unicode both on client and database side you should not forget about PHP itself. Indeed, PHP through the optional mbstring module gives at your disposal a set of functions named *multibyte string functions* that allow you to deal with unicode string with no worry. And what does it mean to you choosing a multibyte string function like mb_stripos() instead of the *standard* stripos()? It means exactly not looking at stripos() failing on unicode strings.
