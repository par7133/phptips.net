    <BODY><![CDATA[      
A certain number of advanced PHP network instructions exist almost in an uncovered fashion: as it is not good to advertise them, as it is not common to find ourself in the need of them. However, when things get hard to test and find out it could happen that working with dns records takes in less variables - ie. you are dealing with an host under load balancing or sites available in different geographical regions). In this cases checkdnsrr() or dns_get_record(), with different php support and implementation, come in handy:

$host = “phptips.net”;
print_r(dns_get_record($host, DNS_A));
