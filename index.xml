    <TITLE>Directory separation</TITLE>
    <BODY><![CDATA[
It is a good practice to separate the resources managed
by the web server from all the other scripts, .php, .inc or whatever
can remain private to the application.
Basically, you can quitely set a Public dir with your php router (usually
the index.php file) and the static content of your web app; while in the Private 
dir you are going to set all the rest of your web app, that you will go to 
include through the router or other mechanism.

    <TITLE>Initialization: one file, easy life</TITLE>
    <BODY><![CDATA[
Having wrote also just a small router for your web app you remain
to decide where to initialize all your web app const, classes, etc.
There is no better way than including an ad-hoc init.inc file where to 
set all the needed resources, initialize session, cache, error
handling, etc.

    <TITLE>Beautiful php, secret include</TITLE>
    <BODY><![CDATA[
When you are going to write some code that needs to be *recognized*
and *served* by the webserver you can write it in a *beautiful* .php
extension. When, instead, you are going to write some classes or 
some reusable code that just needs to be *included* and *not served*
to the user it is the time to write a *secret* .inc file. The point is 
exactly that your frontend webserver is most probably not configured 
to serve the .inc files. Remember that this choice is safe only when 
it is adopted in conjunction with a directory separation approach.
