<![CDATA[
It is good practice to separate the location of the resources managed
by the web server from all the other scripts .php, .inc or whatever
that can remain private to the application.<br>
Basically, you can quitely set a Public dir with your php router (usually
the index.php file) and the static content of your web app while in the Private 
dir you will set all the rest of the web app, you will go to include through
the router or other mechanism.

<![CDATA[
Having wrote also just a small router for your web app you remain
to decide where to initialize all your web app const, classes, contexts, etc.
There is no better place than having an ad-hoc init.inc (or .php) file where to 
include all the needed resources, initialize session, cache, error
handling, etc.
