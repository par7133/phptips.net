PHP language is continuosly evolving and assimilating new functionalities 
becoming more fast too. 
Beside this point it is nice to have coding good practices and a profiling 
tool to tune your own PHP code: Webgrind is surely the tool that needs to 
be in your coding bag. It is a web app, written in PHP, easy to deploy 
and easy to understand (that is never too bad); it makes use of Xdebug 
under the cover.

Do not hurry John Doe, it is not arrived the time to scale yet. 
But - maybe - have to always use good coding best practices, mh? 
Sure no one say us what to obay to coding in PHP - and lucky it 
is so.. However, there are some practices we can use with ease: 
- Take advantage of type hints since PHP ver 7.
- Set variable types with settype.
- Pass and "consume" arrays by reference.
- Use overwhelming quantity of constants.
- Prefer explicit to implicit type conversions.
